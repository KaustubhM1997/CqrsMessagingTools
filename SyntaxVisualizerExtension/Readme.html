    <p>
        The Roslyn Syntax Visualizer is a Visual Studio Extension that will enable inspection
        of 'live' Roslyn SyntaxTrees for any C# or VB code file that is open inside the
        Visual Studio IDE when the Roslyn Language Service is present (e.g. when running
        or debugging other Roslyn extensions).
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the visualizer, you will need to build the <strong>SyntaxVisualizerExtension</strong>
        project. After building, the visualizer extension will be installed and available
        for all instances of Visual Studio that are started with the Roslyn Language Service.
        For example, all of the Roslyn code issue and code refactoring samples run in instances
        of Visual Studio with the Roslyn Language Service - so the visualizer will be available
        when you are running or debugging any code issue or code refactoring samples.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also test the visualizer by setting the <strong>SyntaxVisualizerExtension</strong>
        project as the startup project and running (CTRL + F5) or debugging (F5) it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a step by step outline of what to do:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set the <strong>SyntaxVisualizerExtension</strong> project as startup project.</li>
        <li>Build and run this project (CTRL + F5 or F5).</li>
        <li>This will bring up a new instance of Visual Studio running with the Roslyn Language
            Service.</li>
        <li>In this Visual Studio instance, open the visualizer window by clicking on <strong>
            View -> Other Windows -> Roslyn Syntax Visualizer</strong>.</li>
        <li>Open any C# or VB code file. This can either be a standalone code file or a code
            file that is part of some project.</li>
        <li>When the code file is opened, the visualizer will display the Roslyn SyntaxTree
            corresponding to this code file.</li>
        <li>You can click on / select any SyntaxNode, SyntaxToken or SyntaxTrivia in the visualizer.
            When you do this, the source text corresponding to the clicked item will also be
            selected in the code editor.</li>
        <li>You can also position the cursor / select text anywhere in the code editor. When
            you do this, the SyntaxNode / SyntaxToken / SyntaxTrivia that best matches the selected
            source text will be highlighted in the visualizer.</li>
        <li>You can also inspect the Properties for the currently selected SyntaxNode / SyntaxToken
            / SyntaxTrivia in the PropertyGrid that is part of the visualizer's user interface.</li>
        <li>In Visual Studio Premium and Visual Studio Ultimate, you can right click on any
            SyntaxNode / SyntaxToken / SyntaxTrivia in the visualizer and click on <strong>Directed
                Syntax Graph</strong>. This will display a graphical representation of the sub-tree
            rooted at the selected SyntaxNode / SyntaxToken / SyntaxTrivia. This feature is
            not available in Visual Studio Professional.</li>
        <li>You can close the visualizer window at any time if you do not wish to have it running.</li>
        <li>You can also disable / uninistall the visualizer using <strong>Tools -> Extension
            Manager</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
